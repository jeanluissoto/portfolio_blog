## What Challenges Gen AI CX have on the horizon?

| Challenges | Description                                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Ethical and Social` | Biases, trust, AI-human balance in customer experience  |
| `Technical`  | Adaptability, training, transparency and scalability of the model  |
| `For Consumers` | Privacy, loss of human contact, transparency  |

## Ethical and Social Challenges {.smaller .scrollable transition="slide"}

::: {layout-ncol="3"}

### **Algorithm Bias Mitigation**

+ AI algorithms can perpetuate existing biases in data, leading to discriminatory recommendations. 
+ The opacity of AI models makes it difficult to identify and mitigate biases
+ A continuous process of vigilance and adaptation is necessary to address ethical challenges as AI becomes more integrated into daily tasks

### **Trustness building by Ethic Implementation**

+ Companies must demonstrate responsible use of AI and protect their customers' personal data.
+ Customers must understand how AI technologies make decisions and have control over the use of their data.
+ Informed consent for data use and compliance with data protection regulations are essential.


### **Managing Human-AI Interaction**

+ AI can automate tasks and provide quick responses, but it still lacks empathy and relationship-building skills.
+ Hybrid systems, which combine AI with human support, are an effective solution to balance efficiency with customer satisfaction.

:::

## Technical Challenges {.smaller .scrollable transition="slide"}

::: {layout-ncol="3"}

### **Continuous Training and Development**

+ Training staff on GenAI capabilities, how to interpret results, and identifying and mitigating potential biases or errors is critical.
+ Training should foster collaboration between humans and GenAI, ensuring employees understand that these technologies are a complement to their skills, not a threat to their jobs.


### **Dependency on an exhaustive Knowledge Base**

+ AI applications in customer service rely heavily on an accurate and up-to-date knowledge base
+ A comprehensive knowledge base should include detailed information about the company's products or services, answers to frequently asked questions, troubleshooting guides, and company policies
+ It is important to establish clear processes for collecting, organizing, and updating information in the knowledge base

### **AI Strategy communication in CX team**

+ Collaborators need to understand how AI will impact their roles and how it can help them be more efficient and effective in their work.
+ It's essential to involve CX employees in the implementation process. Their feedback can help ensure that AI tools and processes are effectively integrated into existing workflows.

:::

## Consumer Challenges {.smaller .scrollable transition="slide"}


::: {layout-ncol="2"}

### Management over Private Data

+ It is crucial to understand how companies collect, store, and use this information.
+ Companies must clearly inform their customers about what type of data they collect, how they use it, and with whom they share it.
+ Companies must obtain explicit customer consent before using their data for GenAI
+ It is essential that customers have control over their data, including the ability to access, modify, or delete the information that companies have collected.

### Loss in Human Interaction

+ Lack of human connection can lead to frustration and feelings of isolation for customers
+ Customers have the right to know whether they are interacting with a machine or a person.
